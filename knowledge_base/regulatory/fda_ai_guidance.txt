FDA Guidance on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Medical Devices
Source: FDA 2021 Guidance Document

Key Requirements:

Demographic Subgroup Analysis:
- Algorithm performance must be evaluated across demographic subgroups
- Minimum requirements: age, sex, race/ethnicity
- Performance metrics must be reported separately for each subgroup
- Substantial differences in performance require justification or mitigation

Algorithmic Bias Considerations:
- Training data must be representative of intended use population
- Underrepresentation of specific groups must be documented
- If performance differs >5% across groups, additional validation required
- Post-market surveillance for fairness required

Data Quality Standards:
- Missing data handling must be documented and justified
- Imputation methods must be validated
- Data quality metrics required in submission
- Bias in training data can lead to 510(k) rejection

Documentation Requirements:
- Dataset composition (demographics, sample sizes)
- Data quality assessment
- Fairness metric calculations
- Mitigation strategies for identified bias
- Validation results by subgroup
