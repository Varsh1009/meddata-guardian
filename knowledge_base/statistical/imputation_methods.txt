Statistical Imputation Methods - Best Practices
Source: Statistical Analysis Handbook

Missing Data Mechanisms:

MCAR (Missing Completely at Random):
- Missingness unrelated to any variable
- Safe to use simple imputation or deletion
- Rare in healthcare data

MAR (Missing at Random):
- Missingness related to observed variables
- KNN or multiple imputation recommended
- Common in clinical datasets

MNAR (Missing Not at Random):
- Missingness related to unobserved values
- Most complex, requires careful handling
- Example: Sicker patients skip tests

Imputation Methods:

Mean/Median Imputation:
- Use when: <5% missing, MCAR assumption holds
- Median preferred for: Skewed data (skewness > |0.5|)
- Mean preferred for: Symmetric data (skewness < |0.5|)
- Limitation: Reduces variance, doesn't preserve relationships

KNN Imputation:
- Use when: 5-20% missing, features correlated
- Predicts missing values using k-nearest neighbors
- Preserves relationships better than mean/median
- Computationally expensive for large datasets

Multiple Imputation (MICE):
- Use when: >20% missing, MAR mechanism
- Creates multiple plausible datasets
- Research gold standard
- Time-intensive, requires statistical expertise

Deletion:
- Use when: <3% missing AND large dataset (>5000 samples)
- May introduce selection bias
- Only acceptable if missingness truly random
