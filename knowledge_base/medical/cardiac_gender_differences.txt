Gender Differences in Cardiac Disease Presentation
Source: Journal of American College of Cardiology, CDC

Symptom Presentation Differences:

Men with heart attacks typically present with:
- Chest pain or discomfort (89% of cases)
- Pain radiating to left arm (72%)
- Shortness of breath (58%)
- Cold sweat (64%)

Women with heart attacks often present with:
- Unusual fatigue (58% of cases) - often only symptom
- Chest discomfort (58%) - less common than men
- Nausea or vomiting (42%)
- Jaw, neck, or back pain (38%)
- Shortness of breath without chest pain (35%)

Clinical Implications:
Models trained predominantly on male patients may miss atypical presentations common in women. Women are 50% more likely to receive initial misdiagnosis in emergency departments. Gender-balanced datasets are critical for detecting diverse symptom patterns.

Historical bias in cardiac research has led to systematic underdiagnosis in women, contributing to higher mortality rates for female heart attack patients under age 50.
