Clinical Cholesterol Guidelines
Source: American Heart Association

Normal Cholesterol Levels:
- Desirable: Less than 200 mg/dL
- Borderline high: 200-239 mg/dL
- High: 240 mg/dL and above
- Very high: 400+ mg/dL indicates severe cardiovascular risk

Clinical Significance:
High cholesterol is a primary risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. Patients with cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL have twice the risk of heart disease compared to those with desirable levels below 200 mg/dL.

In heart disease prediction models, patients with very high cholesterol (>400 mg/dL) represent the highest-risk population and are critical for model training. Removing these values as "outliers" would eliminate the most predictive cases.

Treatment thresholds vary by patient risk factors, but levels above 190 mg/dL typically warrant intervention in high-risk patients.
