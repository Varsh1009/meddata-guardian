Indigenous American Health Disparities
Source: CDC Health Disparities Report, Indian Health Service

Cardiovascular Disease in Indigenous Populations:

Prevalence:
- Heart disease death rate: 2x higher than non-Hispanic whites
- Diabetes prevalence: 3x national average (major cardiac risk factor)
- Hypertension: 1.5x more prevalent
- Stroke mortality: 1.4x higher

Contributing Factors:
- Limited access to healthcare (rural/reservation isolation)
- Lower rates of preventive care
- Higher rates of risk factors (smoking, obesity, diabetes)
- Socioeconomic barriers
- Historical trauma and chronic stress

Clinical Implications:
AI models trained without Indigenous patient representation will be completely unreliable for this population. Indigenous communities already face significant healthcare disparities - biased algorithms worsen existing inequities.

Recommended Approach:
Partner with Tribal Health Centers, Indian Health Service facilities, and urban Indian health organizations. Meaningful engagement with tribal communities required for ethical data collection. Consultation with tribal IRBs recommended.
